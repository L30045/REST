function cdn = current_density_norm_light(virtual_topography, virtual_chanlocs, cdn_matrix)
% current_density_norm calculates the current density norm as described in 
% Automatic Classification of Artifactual ICA-Components for Artifact 
% Removal in EEG Signals by Irene Winkler, Stefan Haufe and Michael 
% Tangermann http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/7/1/30
%
% Input:
% eeg: EEGLab data structure with additional fields
% virtual_topography and virtual_chanlocs. See the readme file for the
% toolbox for details on these fields.
%
% Output:
% cdn: Vector of current density norms for the ICs in the EEGLab data
% structure.
